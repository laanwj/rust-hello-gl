A port of Joe Groff's "hello" world tutorial to Rust.

The SDL 1.2 / GLES 2 version that this is based on is at
https://github.com/robn/hello-gl.

Joe's original is at https://github.com/jckarter/hello-gl

You'll need to grab https://github.com/brson/rust-sdl and
https://github.com/mozilla-servo/rust-opengles to build this. And you may need
some patches from their queues as well, if they haven't been merged yet. But if
you're honestly considering playing with this then maybe try talking to me. I'm
robn on Mozilla IRC and Freenode, and lurking in #rust and #servo.
